# what is this?

its annoyingly hard for a humanbeing to make appointments for residency card in ireland.
you must use a service and pay around €50 to buy a bot that will make the appointment for you.
this is unfair, as we already have to pay €300 for the card itself.
so this bot will do the job for you, you dont have to pay ridicilous amount of money into fight of bots!
the website to do the bookings: https://burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie

# is it risky to enter my personal data in this code?

well, you can check what the code does. it only submits your data into govt portal. but, **IT IS RISKY YOU ARE USING SOME BOTS FOR €50 AND SUBMITTING YOUR DATA, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH YOUR DATA**
